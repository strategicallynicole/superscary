Publish your work on a custom domain, invite your audience to subscribe, send them new content by email newsletter, and offer premium subscriptions to generate sustainable recurring revenue to fund your work. </p><p>Ghost is an independent, open source app, which means you can customize absolutely everything. Inside the admin area, you'll find straightforward controls for changing themes, colors, navigation, logos and settings — so you can set your site up just how you like it. No technical knowledge required.</p><p>If you're feeling a little more adventurous, there's really no limit to what's possible. With just a little bit of HTML and CSS you can modify or build your very own theme from scratch, or connect to Zapier to explore advanced integrations. Advanced developers can go even further and build entirely custom workflows using the Ghost API.</p><p>This level of customization means that Ghost grows with you. It's easy to get started, but there's always another level of what's possible. So, you won't find yourself outgrowing the app in a few months time and wishing you'd chosen something more powerful!</p><hr><p>For now, you're probably just wondering what to do first. To help get you going as quickly as possible, we've populated your site with starter content (like this post!) covering all the key concepts and features of the product.</p><p>You'll find an outline of all the different topics below, with links to each section so you can explore the parts that interest you most.</p><p>Once you're ready to begin publishing and want to clear out these starter posts, you can delete the "Ghost" staff user. Deleting an author will automatically remove all of their posts, leaving you with a clean blank canvas.</p><h2 id="your-guide-to-ghost">Your guide to Ghost</h2><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/design/">Customizing your brand and site settings</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/write/">Writing &amp; managing content, an advanced guide for creators</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/portal/">Building your audience with subscriber signups</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/sell/">Selling premium memberships with recurring revenue</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/grow/">How to grow your business around an audience</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/integrations/">Setting up custom integrations and apps</a></li></ul><p>If you get through all those and you're hungry for more, you can find an extensive library of content for creators over on <a href="https://ghost.org/blog/">the Ghost blog</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2><p>If you need help, <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> customers can always reach our full-time support team by clicking on the <em>Ghost(Pro)</em> link inside their admin panel.</p><p>If you're a developer working with the codebase in a self-managed install, check out our <a href="https://forum.ghost.org">developer community forum</a> to chat with other users.</p><p>Have fun!</p></hr></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Customizing your brand and design settings]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to tweak a few settings in Ghost to transform your site from a generic template to a custom brand with style and personality.]]></description><link>https://scaryberries.netlify.app/design/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__609d536a223688243ba0df28</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 16:27:27 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/publishing-options.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/publishing-options.png" alt="Customizing your brand and design settings"/><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/welcome/">introduction</a> post, one of the best things about Ghost is just how much you can customize to turn your site into something unique. Everything about your layout and design can be changed, so you're not stuck with yet another clone of a social network profile.</p><p>How far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there's no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost's built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. </p><p>The best way to get started is with Ghost's branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Customizing your brand and design settings" loading="lazy" width="3456" height="2338"><figcaption>Ghost Admin → Settings → Branding</figcaption></img></figure><p>Any Ghost theme that's up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.</p><p>When selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.</p><h2 id="installing-ghost-themes">Installing Ghost themes</h2><p>By default, new sites are created with Ghost's friendly publication theme, called Casper. Everything in Casper is optimized to work for the most common types of blog, newsletter and publication that people create with Ghost — so it's a perfect place to start.</p><p>However, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/themesettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Customizing your brand and design settings" loading="lazy" width="3208" height="1618"><figcaption>Ghost Admin → Settings → Theme</figcaption></img></figure><p>Inside Ghost's theme settings you'll find 4 more official themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.</p><ul><li><strong>Casper</strong> <em>(default)</em> — Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters</li><li><strong>Edition</strong> — A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors</li><li><strong>Alto</strong> — A slick news/magazine style design for creators</li><li><strong>London</strong> — A light photography theme with a bold grid</li><li><strong>Ease</strong> — A library theme for organizing large content archives</li></ul><p>And if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/">Ghost Marketplace</a>, where you'll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.</p><h2 id="building-something-custom">Building something custom</h2><p>Finally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.</p><p>Ghost's theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.</p><p>If you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it's like, you can <a href="https://github.com/tryghost/casper/">browse through the files of the default Casper theme</a>. We've added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-handlebars">{{#post}}

Don't let its minimal looks fool you, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to accommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.</p><p>For many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.</p><p>Our main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work. </p><ul><li>You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting. </li><li>Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.</li><li>Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.</li><li>Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link.</li><li>You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/editor.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="3182" height="1500"><figcaption>The Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.</figcaption></img></figure><p>The goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to <em>think</em> so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous "block builders" here, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but identical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.</p><p>What you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media into your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.</p><h2 id="using-cards">Using cards</h2><p>You can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the <code>+</code> button, which appears on new lines, or by typing <code>/</code> on a new line to trigger the card menu. Many of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow you to create rich links with embedded structured data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Open Subscription Platforms</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">A shared movement for independent subscription data.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/favicon.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Open Subscription Platforms</span></img></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/osp-card.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"/></div></a></figure><p>or embed cards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience, from external services:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmH3XMlms8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""/></figure><p>But, dig a little deeper, and you'll also find more advanced cards, like one that only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions) and a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and galleries.</p><blockquote>Once you  start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of the story changes. Suddenly, you're working in a new format.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-xSMqGH7gi6o-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="6000" height="4000"/></figure><p>As it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really well. Telling people a great story often has much more impact if they can feel, even for a moment, as though they were right there with you.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-e4yK8QQlZa0-unsplash.jpg" width="4572" height="3048" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"/></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/steve-carter-Ixp4YhCKZkI-unsplash.jpg" width="4032" height="2268" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"/></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/lukasz-szmigiel-jFCViYFYcus-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1705"/></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/jd-mason-hPiEFq6-Eto-unsplash.jpg" width="5184" height="3888" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"/></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/jp-valery-OBpOP9GVH9U-unsplash.jpg" width="5472" height="3648" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"/></div></div></div><figcaption>Peaceful places</figcaption></figure><p>Galleries and image cards can be combined in so many different ways — the only limit is your imagination.</p><h2 id="build-workflows-with-snippets">Build workflows with snippets</h2><p>One of the most powerful features of the Ghost editor is the ability to create and re-use content snippets. If you've ever used an email client with a concept of <em>saved replies</em> then this will be immediately intuitive.</p><p>To create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the <code>/</code> command.</p><p>This works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/createsnippet.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="2282" height="1272"/></figure><p>You can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.</p><p>Once you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.</p><hr><h2 id="publishing-and-newsletters-the-easy-way">Publishing and newsletters the easy way</h2><p>When you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the <em>Preview</em> link and you'll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/preview.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="3166" height="2224"/></figure><p>You can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the <em>Publish</em> button to decide who to deliver it to.</p><p>Ghost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We've spent countless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all email clients, and performs well for email deliverability.</p><p>So, you don't need to fight the awful process of building a custom email template from scratch. It's all done already!</p><hr><p>The Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a little exploration, you'll be up and running in no time.</p></hr></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building your audience with subscriber signups]]></title><description><![CDATA[How Ghost allows you to turn anonymous readers into an audience of active subscribers, so you know what's working and what isn't.]]></description><link>https://scaryberries.netlify.app/portal/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__609d536a223688243ba0df24</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 16:27:25 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.png" alt="Building your audience with subscriber signups"/><p>What sets Ghost apart from other products is that you can publish content and grow your audience using the same platform. Rather than just endlessly posting and hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work and have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes all this possible is called <em>Portal</em>.</p><p>Portal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site. It works on every Ghost site, with every theme, and for any type of publisher. </p><p>You can customize the design, content and settings of Portal to suit your site, whether you just want people to sign up to your newsletter — or you're running a full premium publication with user sign-ins and private content.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/portalsettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building your audience with subscriber signups" loading="lazy" width="2924" height="1810"/></figure><p>Once people sign up to your site, they'll receive an email confirmation with a link to click. The link acts as an automatic sign-in, so subscribers will be automatically signed-in to your site when they click on it. There are a couple of interesting angles to this:</p><p>Because subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as registered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages depending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some posts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a great draw to encourage people to sign up!</p><p>Ghost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no passwords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email subscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site. Like magic.</p><p>Portal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out, clicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in, clicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their name, email, and subscription settings.</p><p>The floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add manual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.</p><p>Like this! <a href="#/portal">Sign up here</a></p><hr><p>As you start to grow your registered audience, you'll be able to get a sense of who you're publishing <em>for</em> and where those people are coming <em>from</em>. Best of all: You'll have a straightforward, reliable way to connect with people who enjoy your work.</p><p>Social networks go in and out of fashion all the time. Email addresses are timeless.</p><p>Growing your audience is valuable no matter what type of site you run, but if your content <em>is</em> your business, then you might also be interested in <a href="https://blog.oakwave.com/sell/">setting up premium subscriptions</a>.</p></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Selling premium memberships with recurring revenue]]></title><description><![CDATA[For creators and aspiring entrepreneurs looking to generate a sustainable

Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</br></p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</br></p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.</br></p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted.

Spend about fifteen minutes on the internet reading about starting a business and no one would blame you if you suddenly decided it wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p><p>Not every statistic is discouraging, but you must be aware of your chances of success before you devote time, money, and a lot of energy to opening and running your new venture. Even if you’re just selling homemade crafts on Etsy, it’s best to keep your expectations low, your hopes high, and to prepare yourself for a lot of work, a lot of setbacks, and a lot of compromises.</p><p>Remember: Just because you have a great idea doesn’t mean it will be a success. You can’t control outside factors like the market, your competition, the economy, and the steady and unrelenting pace of technological disruption.</p><p>All you can do is make decisions based on the best evidence. And even if you devote every hour of your life to your business, there’s still no guarantee that you’ll succeed.</p><p>This is not an attempt to dissuade you from starting a business; there is some good news, after all. We just want to put arm you with the information you’ll need for your journey. The data presented here will help you reduce risk when you can and hopefully make better decisions.</p><p>First, the Good News</p><p>The good news is that you stand on a precipice where many have stood before you.</p><p>By starting a business, you’re engaging in one of the greatest traditions in the history of free society. People respect business owners because they create new opportunities for others and they contribute to their communities, both in terms of culture and wealth. Most businesses start small and never get big, but even those that remain small can become cornerstones of their local communities.</p><p>Small and new businesses also contribute a great deal to the national economy. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses generate about 44% of U.S. economic activity. That’s a decent-sized chunk of the pie when you consider the shares some giant companies have in their markets. Amazon maintained 47% of all retail ecommerce sales in 2019. Not everyone gets to be Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Most counties and states, as well as the federal government, want to encourage people to start businesses, so there are a lot of benefits available to new entrepreneurs:</p><ul><li>SBA-guaranteed loans and grants</li><li>Free advice from small business centers</li><li>Events at your local chamber of commerce</li><li>Possible tax write-offs and advantages (such as pass-through income)</li><li>Easy ways to incorporate and organize</li></ul><p>Small businesses employ almost half of the country’s workforce and comprise 99.7% of firms with paid employees.</p><p>Thanks, entrepreneurs!</p><p>Now, are you ready for the bad news?</p><p>Most New Businesses Fail (Eventually)</p><p>One of the most frequently cited statistics of the past few decades states that half of new businesses fail during their first year. Some pessimistic doomsayers have even cited higher percentages. In 2014, Fortune Magazine reported that 90% of startups fail, which is a grim statistic indeed.</p><p>But according to the SBA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these numbers aren’t quite right when you look at them in context.</p><p>SBA statistics suggest that about 80% of new businesses survive past their first year of operation. This number has stayed pretty consistent since the ‘90s. It didn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.</p><p>Unfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_C2B868CB6E7DD243AAF6A4A278CDF2C74EEF5B9B1351FB1E5768E6BF905A1A0E_1571544345816_Business+Survival+Rate+Chart.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy"/></figure><p>(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p><p>That’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around 70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail eventually. Ouch.</p><p>The BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally stating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the economy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will eventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks cohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to year[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”</p><p>Naturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession and tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary by industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a hair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.</p><p>But economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of other reasons a business can fail.</p><p>According to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses fail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.</p><p>When asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup owners said it was because there was no market need for their product or service, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of failure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by competitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you do need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).</p><p>Other causes of failure from the study include the following:</p><ul><li>Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly</li><li>Poor marketing</li><li>Ignoring customers</li><li>Launching at the wrong time</li><li>Lack of focus or passion</li><li>Disharmony among team members and investors</li><li>Failed expansions</li><li>A lack of financing or investor interest</li><li>Legal problems</li><li>Burnout</li></ul><p>Basically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a business is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get complicated.</p><p>Most Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There</p><p>Based on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30 million business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5 people, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.</p><p>If this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.</p><p>The reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about 7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of those businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of their own homes.</p><p>One of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch Colleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes. The more interesting statistic from the report is that 59% of established businesses were still based in people’s homes.</p><p>That’s an old study, but high-speed internet access has only expanded since 2012 and online marketplaces have boomed. Today, you can start a home-based business with nothing but a MacBook and an internet connection.</p><p>This trend also makes sense given the high costs associated with starting a traditional brick and mortar business. In addition to startup costs, there’s rent, new technologies, employee overhead, marketing, and more.</p><p>If you’re starting your business from your living room with visions of making it big, keep in mind that you may still be running operations in your pajama pants a year or two down the line. There are ways to expand quickly, like raising capital or taking out a loan, but it all depends on your tolerance for risk.</p><p>Most Business Owners Work Way More Than 40 Hours Each Week</p><p>If you know anyone who owns a business, you don’t even need studies to verify this. But one common mistake new entrepreneurs make is assuming they’ll be able to work fewer hours because they can delegate their responsibilities to others and make their own schedules.</p><p>While this isn’t unheard of, it’s a rarity when you look at the numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the majority of small-business owners work at least 50 hours per week, while 25% said they work more than 60.</p><p>Most Businesses Are Struggling to Retain Employees</p><p>In the 20th century, it wasn’t unheard of for someone to stay at the same company for 40 years, build themselves a nice middle-class life, then retire with a pension.</p><p>Times have changed.</p><p>Few people today expect their employers to take care of them, and fewer still are satisfied enough with their jobs to stay longer than a few years. A 2019 Deloitte survey found that this is especially true among younger employees. Forty-nine percent of Millennials say they intend to leave their current job in 2 years, and 25% of those same respondents had already left a job within the previous 2 years.</p><p>A recovering economy, an increasingly educated workforce, and a low unemployment rate have all contributed to this trend. Nothing lasts forever, but the nature of what people want from their work is changing and influencing turnover as well. Few people are happy with just a paycheck — they want opportunities for career advancement, and they want to be recognized for their ideas.</p><p>A Gallup study showed that 79% of employees leave their jobs not because they aren’t making enough money but because they aren’t being appreciated. Despite how you might feel about holding your employees’ hands and singing kumbaya, this is the new reality.</p><p>To reduce turnover, you’ll need to prioritize the following:</p><ul><li>Develop a hiring process that gets the right people through your door</li><li>Offer attractive benefits packages</li><li>Provide opportunities for ongoing education and cross-training</li><li>Enable employees to share their ideas</li><li>Recognize employee excellence</li><li>Create company traditions and establish a set of values</li><li>Create flexible start and end times for workdays</li><li>Allow employees to work from home, if possible</li><li>Ensure employees understand their roles and responsibilities</li><li>Stand for something beyond profit</li></ul><p>If you’re just starting your business, you probably don’t have an HR department to back you up. Start with the basics, like an employee health plan and a 401(k). Many startups offer their employees stock options to sweeten the deal and build a team atmosphere.</p><p>No One’s Going to Get Rich Quick</p><p>You may have heard stories of unicorn startups being bought up by big companies, their bright-eyed CEOs retiring early and sailing off into the sunset on their mega-yachts at the ripe old age of 34.</p><p>If you’re starting a business with the goal of getting rich quick, you aren’t going into business for the right reasons.</p><p>This isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen; it just happens so infrequently that it’s on par with winning millions on a scratch ticket or signing up your garage band with a big record label before you reach the legal drinking age.</p><p>Most studies indicate that entrepreneurs tend to make a yearly salary that’s above average, but they certainly don’t have swimming pools filled with Spanish Doubloons. American Express OPEN found that more than half of entrepreneurs paid themselves a full-time salary of $68,000 in 2017.</p><p>That’s a decent salary by most standards, but it doesn’t suggest starting a business is a direct path to Easy Street. Successful entrepreneurs tend to start businesses for other reasons, like the desire for professional freedom or the urge to fill a need in the market with a new idea.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Science Behind Emotional Branding]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The way something looks and feels evokes an emotional connection.</br></p><p>"The results showed that strong brands activated a network of cortical areas and areas involved in positive emotional processing and associated with self-identification and rewards." - Dr. Christine Born, M.D., Radiologist at University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, Germany</p><blockquote>Strong brands fire up the brain with less effort while weaker brands elicited a negative emotional response and took more effort.</blockquote><p>Emotional branding can trigger your unconscious. These studies show that emotion stimulates the brain 3x faster than logic. Before you can even start to analyze the facts, your unconscious has already made up its mind.</p><p>Another study by the Department of Neuroscience at Baylor College of Medicine focused on soft drink choices. When presented with two options, in a blind test, participants did not show preference for one sample over another. That makes sense since the two samples were identical. Measured brain activity verified similar responses. However, after being told one of the samples was Pepsi and the other was Coke, the results changes. The majority of tasters picked Coke as the better sample only after being told it was Coca Cola.</p><h3 id="visual-connections-trigger-past-memories">Visual Connections Trigger Past Memories</h3><p>Your brain makes these connections almost immediately. When it encounters something, it assesses what it sees, hears, and feels and tries to associate it with past experiences to assign value. A nostalgic memory of the first car you own may lead to you always thinking fondly about the brand. A negative experience with a particular insurance agent may trigger negative thoughts about the parent company.

It can play on a customer's ego. It can reinforce positive associations. It can trigger an emotional response that facts never will.<br/></p><p>Quite simply, it makes you feel connected to others, a base physiological need to thrive as a human being.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What are some hard truths about running a business?]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The Short Answer:
All of them, but we specialize in B2B (though we have had MANY B2C clients as
well, it’s just not our core strength).  We have a penchant for franchise sales,
SaaS, medical, and manufacturing.  But, only because we’ve had clusters of
clients in each of those areas.  As long as the nature of the challenge is
marketing, sales, or business, we’re specialized there.  This requires a lot

Basically, a client is paying a lower price for access to a template, or formula, by which they can execute their marketing. Since this template has literally zero emotional connection with the target audience and is reused over and over and over, it is effective at the moment it is being executed (if the odds are in your favor) and ineffective in building the brand or anything with staying power. There are exceptions to this, but they are just that, diamonds in the rough. It does not build the brand behind the marketing or proliferate a unique differentiation. Why is that important? Authors greater than me have written literal tomes about the necessity of competitive differentiation.</br></p><p>There's an old adage about being an inch deep and a mile wide versus a mile deep and an inch wide.  In marketing, it was always meant to be a mile wide and inch deep.  If you put all of your eggs in one basket, one approach, chances are high that the tech will change or the market will change or the industry will change or something will break everything.</p><p>In marketing, and in business, you never allow yourself in a position in which all of your leads will be cut off in one swoop.  When did that become acceptable?  Campaigns were born from the idea of attacking on multiple fronts with a unified message.  Attacking on one or two fronts with a varied message?  Or no real message at all?  How does that make any sense?  Even if you have the same message, you still are putting all your eggs in one basket.  That's not just bad marketing, that's bad business.</p><p>The moment we start commoditizing and templating what should be more creativity than anything is the moment we destroy it.</p><p>What happens in 99% of these templated relationships is that the client ends up paying for something that they can barely afford or understand.  It\ yields little to no lasting results, or mediocre results that stop as soon as they stop paying. There is no originality in any of their advertising or campaigns. There is no genuine thought leadership. Hell, there is no original thought. It’s marketing on the rinse-and-repeat cycle.</p><p>What was and still could be the industry with the most opportunity to evolve our society as a whole, is also the one responsible for society’s regression.</p><hr><p>If you liked the "long answer," check out the book written by our CEO, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Marketing-industry-turning-monster-ebook/dp/B08511CSC4/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=bad+marketing&amp;qid=1582857549&amp;sr=8-2">Bad Marketing:  Our industry is turning into a monster!</a></p></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[We are good people who do what we love for good people who need what we do.]]></title><link>https://scaryberries.netlify.app/we-are-good-people-who-do-what-we-love-for-good-people-who-need-what-we-do/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__60c3dc7a223688243ba0e0d8</guid><category><![CDATA[business]]></category><category><![CDATA[who we are]]></category><category><![CDATA[who we help]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicole Choman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 21:58:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is Human Marketing?]]></title><description><![CDATA[We truly believe in the idea of human marketing.

It is one of three requirements for marketing to be considered “Good Marketing” (a “very original” phrase we lovingly coined). During the COVID19 crisis, we have seen the “human marketing” ethos become almost desperately relevant. But what is human marketing and how can you possibly label it? It seems abstract and fluffy.</p><p/><p>It’s not abstract and fluffy. It ties back to hard dollars and revenue and it’s not about spreading peace and love via psychedelics (okay, well maybe a little bit).</p><p>Human marketing means (to us):</p><ul><li>Showing the genuine emotions of your brand</li><li>Being in-touch/empathetic with your target market.</li></ul><p><br>Typically, to show the genuine emotions of your brand, you must show some vulnerability. There are hundreds of amazing examples of brands that do just this (and collected the benefits of doing so). We share a few in our book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Marketing-industry-turning-monster-ebook/dp/B08511CSC4">Bad Marketing</a>, but recently, we’ve seen some amazing examples as specific to COVID19.</br></p><p>This TV spot, by Truist, the recent merger of BB&amp;T and Suntrust, had us in tears—quite literally, in tears. (Any ad that <em>actually</em> makes you cry will always pass the “human” test.)</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B_ok0aZVpg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B_ok0aZVpg</a></p><p>They are not only showing the genuine emotions of their brand, but they are tapping into and echoing back the emotions of their audience. Watch that ad and tell us if it doesn’t at least make you feel something.</p><p>Domino’s did an ad recently for their employment opportunities that we believe was actually a brand builder (and intentionally so) far more than a recruiter. The timing was too perfect with the release of their new catchline “We’re Here To Feed the Need,” and the COVID19 restaurant disaster. The ad was genuine, heartfelt, and appropriately-timed.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHtxQ4X2YSE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHtxQ4X2YSE</a></p><p>This ad is emotional because it speaks to our common emotions, it touches our hearts because we can RELATE to the emotions the franchisee’s are experiencing now. We can understand them. We get them.</p><p>Of course, human marketing doesn’t just apply to ads and videos. Whenever you can walk in your buyers’ footsteps, feel their heartbeat, and relate to their individual struggles and needs, you can shape your campaign around them. When a campaign is born of genuine service to a market’s needs, that’s human marketing. Human marketing will beat out sales, coupons, gimmicks, features, benefits, and slogans any day of the week.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
