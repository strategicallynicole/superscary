The business failure rate is so high because there are a great many people\n     whose friends and family weren’t ballsy enough to tell them that they\n     should never open a business.

There are hundreds of amazing examples of brands that do just\nthis (and collected the benefits of doing so). We share a few in our book, Bad\nMarketing\n[https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Marketing-industry-turning-monster-ebook/dp/B08511CSC4]\n, but recently, we’ve seen some amazing examples as specific to COVID19.\n\nThis TV spot, by Truist, the recent merger of BB&T and Suntrust, had us in\ntears—quite literally, in tears.

The ad was genuine,\nheartfelt, and appropriately-timed.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHtxQ4X2YSE\n\nThis ad is emotional because it speaks to our common emotions, it touches our\nhearts because we can RELATE to the emotions the franchisee’s are experiencing\nnow. We can understand them. We get them.\n\nOf course, human marketing doesn’t just apply to ads and videos. Whenever you\ncan walk in your buyers’ footsteps, feel their heartbeat, and relate to their\nindividual struggles and needs, you can shape your campaign around them. When a\ncampaign is born of genuine service to a market’s needs, that’s human marketing.\nHuman marketing will beat out sales, coupons, gimmicks, features, benefits, and\nslogans any day of the week.","html":"<p>We truly believe in the idea of human marketing.

The timing was too perfect with the release of their new catchline “We’re Here To Feed the Need,” and the COVID19 restaurant disaster. The ad was genuine, heartfelt, and appropriately-timed.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHtxQ4X2YSE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHtxQ4X2YSE</a></p><p>This ad is emotional because it speaks to our common emotions, it touches our hearts because we can RELATE to the emotions the franchisee’s are experiencing now. We can understand them. We get them.</p><p>Of course, human marketing doesn’t just apply to ads and videos.
