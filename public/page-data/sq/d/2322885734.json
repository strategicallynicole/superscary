You have only a second or two to get and hold their attention, and in order to earn a click in the first place, you must be in one of the top spots on Google. Users who go to page 2 are rare, but streakers never do.</p><p>Short form content, fast loading pages, quick answers, simple shopping and checkout features, brief product descriptions, and short video clips and even small infographics or photo essays all appeal to streakers. Content that takes just a moment to browse and understand is the best way to reach them.</p><h1 id=\"strollers\"><strong>Strollers</strong></h1><p>Strollers are not in a huge hurry like their streaker counterparts, however, they are also not invested in a multiple-thread, lengthy search. Sometimes a stroller does not exactly know what they are looking for yet. They are at the point in the sales funnel where they know they have a want or need but have no clue what the solution might be.</p><p>In some cases, they may also not know they have a want or need, and by attracting their attention, you may be able to show it to them. Think of the stroller as a window shopper. Your objective is to attract and hold their attention.</p><p>The thing about strollers is that they are easily distracted. Appealing to them means medium form, medium length content, but it must also be well-written and informative content that is visually appealing and accurate. They will get bored with content that is too long and will close tabs quickly on content that is superficial.</p><h1 id=\"studiers\"><strong>Studiers</strong></h1><p>The studier is different.

Not only are they vested in their own solutions, they often like to share these solutions with others. If your content appeals to them and you have a good product to back it up, they will become your greatest ambassadors.

You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.</p><p>Our main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work. </p><ul><li>You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting. </li><li>Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.</li><li>Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.</li><li>Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link.</li><li>You can also paste (or write!)

Don't let its minimal looks fool\nyou, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to\naccommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.\n\nFor many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start\nwriting as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would\nexpect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.\n\nOur main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things\nthat you hope/expect might work: actually work. \n\n * You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best\n   to correctly preserve the formatting. \n * Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.\n * Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.\n * Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top:\n   Ghost will turn it into a link.\n * You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to\n   auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.\n\nThe Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.\nThe goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to \nthink so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous \"block builders\"\nhere, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but\nidentical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.\n\nWhat you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media\ninto your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.\n\nUsing cards\nYou can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the + button, which\nappears on new lines, or by typing / on a new line to trigger the card menu.\nMany of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow\nyou to create rich links with embedded structured data:\n\nOpen Subscription PlatformsA shared movement for independent subscription data.\nOpen Subscription Platforms [https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/]or embed\ncards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience,\nfrom external services:\n\nBut, dig a little deeper, and you'll also find more advanced cards, like one\nthat only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions)\nand a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and\ngalleries.\n\n> Once you  start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of\nthe story changes.

If you've ever used an email client with a concept\nof saved replies then this will be immediately intuitive.\n\nTo create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to\nre-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your\nsnippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from\nwithin the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the / command.\n\nThis works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a\ncompany logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking\nto, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.\n\nYou can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick,\nre-usable workflow for publishing over time.
