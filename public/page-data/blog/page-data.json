Don't let its minimal looks fool\nyou, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to\naccommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.\n\nFor many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start\nwriting as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would\nexpect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.\n\nOur main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things\nthat you hope/expect might work: actually work. \n\n * You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best\n   to correctly preserve the formatting. \n * Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.\n * Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.\n * Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top:\n   Ghost will turn it into a link.\n * You can also paste (or write!)

Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.\nThe goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to \nthink so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous \"block builders\"\nhere, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but\nidentical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.\n\nWhat you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media\ninto your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.\n\nUsing cards\nYou can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the + button, which\nappears on new lines, or by typing / on a new line to trigger the card menu.\nMany of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow\nyou to create rich links with embedded structured data:\n\nOpen Subscription PlatformsA shared movement for independent subscription data.\nOpen Subscription Platforms [https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/]or embed\ncards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience,\nfrom external services:\n\nBut, dig a little deeper, and you'll also find more advanced cards, like one\nthat only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions)\nand a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and\ngalleries.\n\n> Once you  start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of\nthe story changes. Suddenly, you're working in a new format.\nAs it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really\nwell. Telling people a great story often has much more impact if they can feel,\neven for a moment, as though they were right there with you.\n\nPeaceful placesGalleries and image cards can be combined in so many different\nways — the only limit is your imagination.\n\nBuild workflows with snippets\nOne of the most powerful features of the Ghost editor is the ability to create\nand re-use content snippets. If you've ever used an email client with a concept\nof saved replies then this will be immediately intuitive.\n\nTo create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to\nre-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your\nsnippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from\nwithin the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the / command.\n\nThis works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a\ncompany logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking\nto, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.\n\nYou can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick,\nre-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for\nyour post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.\n\nOnce you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old\nway of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know\nyou used somewhere that one time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublishing and newsletters the easy way\nWhen you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver\nyour new post to all your existing members. Just hit the Preview link and you'll\nget a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and\nSocial.\n\nYou can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in\nyour email client, and then hit the Publish button to decide who to deliver it\nto.\n\nGhost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has\nsettings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We've spent\ncountless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all\nemail clients, and performs well for email deliverability.\n\nSo, you don't need to fight the awful process of building a custom email\ntemplate from scratch. It's all done already!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a\nlittle exploration, you'll be up and running in no time.","html":"<p>Ghost comes with a best-in-class editor which does its very best to get out of the way, and let you focus on your content.

If you've ever used an email client with a concept of <em>saved replies</em> then this will be immediately intuitive.</p><p>To create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the <code>/</code> command.</p><p>This works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/createsnippet.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2282\" height=\"1272\"></figure><p>You can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.</p><p>Once you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.</p><hr><h2 id=\"publishing-and-newsletters-the-easy-way\">Publishing and newsletters the easy way</h2><p>When you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members.

And even if you\ndevote every hour of your life to your business, there’s still no guarantee that\nyou’ll succeed.\n\nThis is not an attempt to dissuade you from starting a business; there is some\ngood news, after all. We just want to put arm you with the information you’ll\nneed for your journey. The data presented here will help you reduce risk when\nyou can and hopefully make better decisions.\n\nFirst, the Good News\n\nThe good news is that you stand on a precipice where many have stood before you.\n\nBy starting a business, you’re engaging in one of the greatest traditions in the\nhistory of free society. People respect business owners because they create new\nopportunities for others and they contribute to their communities, both in terms\nof culture and wealth. Most businesses start small and never get big, but even\nthose that remain small can become cornerstones of their local communities.\n\nSmall and new businesses also contribute a great deal to the national economy.\nAccording to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses generate\nabout 44% of U.S. economic activity. That’s a decent-sized chunk of the pie when\nyou consider the shares some giant companies have in their markets. Amazon\nmaintained 47% of all retail ecommerce sales in 2019. Not everyone gets to be\nJeff Bezos.\n\nMost counties and states, as well as the federal government, want to encourage\npeople to start businesses, so there are a lot of benefits available to new\nentrepreneurs:\n\n * SBA-guaranteed loans and grants\n * Free advice from small business centers\n * Events at your local chamber of commerce\n * Possible tax write-offs and advantages (such as pass-through income)\n * Easy ways to incorporate and organize\n\nSmall businesses employ almost half of the country’s workforce and comprise\n99.7% of firms with paid employees.\n\nThanks, entrepreneurs!\n\nNow, are you ready for the bad news?\n\nMost New Businesses Fail (Eventually)\n\nOne of the most frequently cited statistics of the past few decades states that\nhalf of new businesses fail during their first year. Some pessimistic doomsayers\nhave even cited higher percentages. In 2014, Fortune Magazine reported that 90%\nof startups fail, which is a grim statistic indeed.\n\nBut according to the SBA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these numbers\naren’t quite right when you look at them in context.\n\nSBA statistics suggest that about 80% of new businesses survive past their first\nyear of operation. This number has stayed pretty consistent since the ‘90s. It\ndidn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.\n\nUnfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:\n\n(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nThat’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around\n70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail\neventually. Ouch.\n\nThe BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally\nstating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the\neconomy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will\neventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks\ncohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to\nyear[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”\n\nNaturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession\nand tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary\nby industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a\nhair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.\n\nBut economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of\nother reasons a business can fail.\n\nAccording to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses\nfail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.\n\nWhen asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup\nowners said it was because there was no market need for their product or\nservice, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of\nfailure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by\ncompetitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you\ndo need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).\n\nOther causes of failure from the study include the following:\n\n * Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly\n * Poor marketing\n * Ignoring customers\n * Launching at the wrong time\n * Lack of focus or passion\n * Disharmony among team members and investors\n * Failed expansions\n * A lack of financing or investor interest\n * Legal problems\n * Burnout\n\nBasically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a\nbusiness is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get\ncomplicated.\n\nMost Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There\n\nBased on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over\n30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30\nmillion business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5\npeople, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.\n\nIf this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.\n\nThe reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about\n7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of\nthose businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of\ntheir own homes.\n\nOne of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global\nEntrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch\nColleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes. The more\ninteresting statistic from the report is that 59% of established businesses were\nstill based in people’s homes.\n\nThat’s an old study, but high-speed internet access has only expanded since 2012\nand online marketplaces have boomed. Today, you can start a home-based business\nwith nothing but a MacBook and an internet connection.\n\nThis trend also makes sense given the high costs associated with starting a\ntraditional brick and mortar business. In addition to startup costs, there’s\nrent, new technologies, employee overhead, marketing, and more.\n\nIf you’re starting your business from your living room with visions of making it\nbig, keep in mind that you may still be running operations in your pajama pants\na year or two down the line. There are ways to expand quickly, like raising\ncapital or taking out a loan, but it all depends on your tolerance for risk.\n\nMost Business Owners Work Way More Than 40 Hours Each Week\n\nIf you know anyone who owns a business, you don’t even need studies to verify\nthis. But one common mistake new entrepreneurs make is assuming they’ll be able\nto work fewer hours because they can delegate their responsibilities to others\nand make their own schedules.\n\nWhile this isn’t unheard of, it’s a rarity when you look at the numbers. The\nBureau of Labor Statistics found that the majority of small-business owners work\nat least 50 hours per week, while 25% said they work more than 60.\n\nMost Businesses Are Struggling to Retain Employees\n\nIn the 20th century, it wasn’t unheard of for someone to stay at the same\ncompany for 40 years, build themselves a nice middle-class life, then retire\nwith a pension.\n\nTimes have changed.\n\nFew people today expect their employers to take care of them, and fewer still\nare satisfied enough with their jobs to stay longer than a few years. A 2019\nDeloitte survey found that this is especially true among younger employees.\nForty-nine percent of Millennials say they intend to leave their current job in\n2 years, and 25% of those same respondents had already left a job within the\nprevious 2 years.\n\nA recovering economy, an increasingly educated workforce, and a low unemployment\nrate have all contributed to this trend. Nothing lasts forever, but the nature\nof what people want from their work is changing and influencing turnover as\nwell. Few people are happy with just a paycheck — they want opportunities for\ncareer advancement, and they want to be recognized for their ideas.\n\nA Gallup study showed that 79% of employees leave their jobs not because they\naren’t making enough money but because they aren’t being appreciated. Despite\nhow you might feel about holding your employees’ hands and singing kumbaya, this\nis the new reality.\n\nTo reduce turnover, you’ll need to prioritize the following:\n\n * Develop a hiring process that gets the right people through your door\n * Offer attractive benefits packages\n * Provide opportunities for ongoing education and cross-training\n * Enable employees to share their ideas\n * Recognize employee excellence\n * Create company traditions and establish a set of values\n * Create flexible start and end times for workdays\n * Allow employees to work from home, if possible\n * Ensure employees understand their roles and responsibilities\n * Stand for something beyond profit\n\nIf you’re just starting your business, you probably don’t have an HR department\nto back you up. Start with the basics, like an employee health plan and a\n401(k). Many startups offer their employees stock options to sweeten the deal\nand build a team atmosphere.\n\nNo One’s Going to Get Rich Quick\n\nYou may have heard stories of unicorn startups being bought up by big companies,\ntheir bright-eyed CEOs retiring early and sailing off into the sunset on their\nmega-yachts at the ripe old age of 34.\n\nIf you’re starting a business with the goal of getting rich quick, you aren’t\ngoing into business for the right reasons.\n\nThis isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen; it just happens so infrequently that\nit’s on par with winning millions on a scratch ticket or signing up your garage\nband with a big record label before you reach the legal drinking age.\n\nMost studies indicate that entrepreneurs tend to make a yearly salary that’s\nabove average, but they certainly don’t have swimming pools filled with Spanish\nDoubloons. American Express OPEN found that more than half of entrepreneurs paid\nthemselves a full-time salary of $68,000 in 2017.\n\nThat’s a decent salary by most standards, but it doesn’t suggest starting a\nbusiness is a direct path to Easy Street. Successful entrepreneurs tend to start\nbusinesses for other reasons, like the desire for professional freedom or the\nurge to fill a need in the market with a new idea.","html":"<p></p><p></p><p>There’s a reason people’s eyes tend to glaze over when someone dives into a long sermon about their new startup.</p><p>When you start a business, the odds just aren’t in your favor — and the evidence is everywhere.

The data presented here will help you reduce risk when you can and hopefully make better decisions.</p><p>First, the Good News</p><p>The good news is that you stand on a precipice where many have stood before you.</p><p>By starting a business, you’re engaging in one of the greatest traditions in the history of free society. People respect business owners because they create new opportunities for others and they contribute to their communities, both in terms of culture and wealth. Most businesses start small and never get big, but even those that remain small can become cornerstones of their local communities.</p><p>Small and new businesses also contribute a great deal to the national economy. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses generate about 44% of U.S. economic activity. That’s a decent-sized chunk of the pie when you consider the shares some giant companies have in their markets. Amazon maintained 47% of all retail ecommerce sales in 2019. Not everyone gets to be Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Most counties and states, as well as the federal government, want to encourage people to start businesses, so there are a lot of benefits available to new entrepreneurs:</p><ul><li>SBA-guaranteed loans and grants</li><li>Free advice from small business centers</li><li>Events at your local chamber of commerce</li><li>Possible tax write-offs and advantages (such as pass-through income)</li><li>Easy ways to incorporate and organize</li></ul><p>Small businesses employ almost half of the country’s workforce and comprise 99.7% of firms with paid employees.</p><p>Thanks, entrepreneurs!</p><p>Now, are you ready for the bad news?</p><p>Most New Businesses Fail (Eventually)</p><p>One of the most frequently cited statistics of the past few decades states that half of new businesses fail during their first year. Some pessimistic doomsayers have even cited higher percentages. In 2014, Fortune Magazine reported that 90% of startups fail, which is a grim statistic indeed.</p><p>But according to the SBA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these numbers aren’t quite right when you look at them in context.</p><p>SBA statistics suggest that about 80% of new businesses survive past their first year of operation. This number has stayed pretty consistent since the ‘90s. It didn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.</p><p>Unfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_C2B868CB6E7DD243AAF6A4A278CDF2C74EEF5B9B1351FB1E5768E6BF905A1A0E_1571544345816_Business+Survival+Rate+Chart.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p><p>That’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around 70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail eventually. Ouch.</p><p>The BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally stating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the economy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will eventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks cohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to year[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”</p><p>Naturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession and tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary by industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a hair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.</p><p>But economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of other reasons a business can fail.</p><p>According to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses fail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.</p><p>When asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup owners said it was because there was no market need for their product or service, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of failure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by competitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you do need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).</p><p>Other causes of failure from the study include the following:</p><ul><li>Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly</li><li>Poor marketing</li><li>Ignoring customers</li><li>Launching at the wrong time</li><li>Lack of focus or passion</li><li>Disharmony among team members and investors</li><li>Failed expansions</li><li>A lack of financing or investor interest</li><li>Legal problems</li><li>Burnout</li></ul><p>Basically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a business is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get complicated.</p><p>Most Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There</p><p>Based on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30 million business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5 people, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.</p><p>If this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.</p><p>The reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about 7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of those businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of their own homes.</p><p>One of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch Colleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes. The more interesting statistic from the report is that 59% of established businesses were still based in people’s homes.</p><p>That’s an old study, but high-speed internet access has only expanded since 2012 and online marketplaces have boomed. Today, you can start a home-based business with nothing but a MacBook and an internet connection.</p><p>This trend also makes sense given the high costs associated with starting a traditional brick and mortar business. In addition to startup costs, there’s rent, new technologies, employee overhead, marketing, and more.</p><p>If you’re starting your business from your living room with visions of making it big, keep in mind that you may still be running operations in your pajama pants a year or two down the line. There are ways to expand quickly, like raising capital or taking out a loan, but it all depends on your tolerance for risk.</p><p>Most Business Owners Work Way More Than 40 Hours Each Week</p><p>If you know anyone who owns a business, you don’t even need studies to verify this. But one common mistake new entrepreneurs make is assuming they’ll be able to work fewer hours because they can delegate their responsibilities to others and make their own schedules.</p><p>While this isn’t unheard of, it’s a rarity when you look at the numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the majority of small-business owners work at least 50 hours per week, while 25% said they work more than 60.</p><p>Most Businesses Are Struggling to Retain Employees</p><p>In the 20th century, it wasn’t unheard of for someone to stay at the same company for 40 years, build themselves a nice middle-class life, then retire with a pension.</p><p>Times have changed.</p><p>Few people today expect their employers to take care of them, and fewer still are satisfied enough with their jobs to stay longer than a few years. A 2019 Deloitte survey found that this is especially true among younger employees. Forty-nine percent of Millennials say they intend to leave their current job in 2 years, and 25% of those same respondents had already left a job within the previous 2 years.</p><p>A recovering economy, an increasingly educated workforce, and a low unemployment rate have all contributed to this trend. Nothing lasts forever, but the nature of what people want from their work is changing and influencing turnover as well. Few people are happy with just a paycheck — they want opportunities for career advancement, and they want to be recognized for their ideas.</p><p>A Gallup study showed that 79% of employees leave their jobs not because they aren’t making enough money but because they aren’t being appreciated. Despite how you might feel about holding your employees’ hands and singing kumbaya, this is the new reality.</p><p>To reduce turnover, you’ll need to prioritize the following:</p><ul><li>Develop a hiring process that gets the right people through your door</li><li>Offer attractive benefits packages</li><li>Provide opportunities for ongoing education and cross-training</li><li>Enable employees to share their ideas</li><li>Recognize employee excellence</li><li>Create company traditions and establish a set of values</li><li>Create flexible start and end times for workdays</li><li>Allow employees to work from home, if possible</li><li>Ensure employees understand their roles and responsibilities</li><li>Stand for something beyond profit</li></ul><p>If you’re just starting your business, you probably don’t have an HR department to back you up. Start with the basics, like an employee health plan and a 401(k). Many startups offer their employees stock options to sweeten the deal and build a team atmosphere.</p><p>No One’s Going to Get Rich Quick</p><p>You may have heard stories of unicorn startups being bought up by big companies, their bright-eyed CEOs retiring early and sailing off into the sunset on their mega-yachts at the ripe old age of 34.</p><p>If you’re starting a business with the goal of getting rich quick, you aren’t going into business for the right reasons.</p><p>This isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen; it just happens so infrequently that it’s on par with winning millions on a scratch ticket or signing up your garage band with a big record label before you reach the legal drinking age.</p><p>Most studies indicate that entrepreneurs tend to make a yearly salary that’s above average, but they certainly don’t have swimming pools filled with Spanish Doubloons. American Express OPEN found that more than half of entrepreneurs paid themselves a full-time salary of $68,000 in 2017.</p><p>That’s a decent salary by most standards, but it doesn’t suggest starting a business is a direct path to Easy Street. Successful entrepreneurs tend to start businesses for other reasons, like the desire for professional freedom or the urge to fill a need in the market with a new idea.</p>","url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/the-somewhat-grim-statistics-of-starting-a-new-business/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"c1f9cd06-23b8-4882-b5e0-2bc569bf01bc","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60c3dad3223688243ba0e0ae","reading_time":7}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60c3db3f223688243ba0e0b7","title":"The Science Behind Emotional Branding","slug":"the-science-behind-emotional-branding","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"excerpt":"\nDr. Christine Born is a radiologist.
